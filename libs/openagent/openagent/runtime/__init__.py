"""Runtime infrastructure modules for OpenAgent.

This package contains framework-agnostic modules that manage
agent runtime behavior:

- Context types (Overwrite, Append, Inject): Message transformation contract
- CompactionController: Stateless 3-phase compaction protocol
- CapabilityRegistry: Stores tools, skills, and MCP servers (pure data)
- PermissionGate: Validates tool calls and handles approvals

Prompt infrastructure lives in ``openagent.prompts``.
