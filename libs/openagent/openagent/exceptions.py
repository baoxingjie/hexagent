    Raise ConfigurationError when:
    - Required environment variables are missing (API keys, credentials)
    - Configuration values are invalid or malformed

    Examples:
        ```python
        if "API_KEY" not in os.environ:

class UnsupportedPlatformError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when the platform doesn't meet requirements.

    Raise UnsupportedPlatformError when:
    - Operating system is not supported (e.g., Windows vs Unix)
    - Architecture is not supported
    - Required system capabilities are missing

    Examples:
        ```python

class MissingDependencyError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when an optional dependency is not installed.

    Raise MissingDependencyError when:
    - An optional package is required but not installed
    - A feature requires additional dependencies

    Examples:
        ```python
        try:

class ToolError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when a tool cannot execute the requested operation.

    This exception indicates infrastructure-level failures where the command
    could not be executed at all. It should NOT be used for command failures
    (non-zero exit codes) - those are returned in ToolResult/CLIResult.

    Raise ToolError when:
    - Tool infrastructure fails (shell not available, permission denied)
    - Session state is invalid (not started, timed out, process died)
    - Timeout waiting for command completion
    - Invalid input (empty command, blocked command)
    - Unexpected internal errors (sanitized to hide implementation details)

    Do NOT raise ToolError when:
    - Command executed but returned non-zero exit code
    - Command produced stderr output
    - Command returned "command not found" (exit 127)

    The agent receives this error and can decide how to proceed (e.g., restart).

    Examples:
        ```python
        try:
            result = await session.run("sleep 1000")
        except ToolError as e:

    """Error raised when the computer has an infrastructure failure.

    This exception indicates that the CLI computer itself encountered an error,
    NOT that a command returned a non-zero exit code.

    Use CLIError for:
    - Computer failed to start
    - Process died unexpectedly
    - Command timed out
    - Internal errors in the computer implementation

    Do NOT use CLIError for:
    - Command returned non-zero exit code (use CLIResult.exit_code)
